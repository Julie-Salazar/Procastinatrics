### Yusuke's Shower Thoughts
- Use either snake_case or camelCase, not both (github actions should help w this)
- Store unit dues on backend, use unit code to suggest assignment dues?

  - Need to restrict to calendar apis, else manual/personal dues might get suggested mistakenly.
- If there's spare time, a way to fit an ELO ranking system just for the sake of it (ranked procrastination)
